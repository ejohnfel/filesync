# filesync
Given two source folders of files, index the files and determine which copies are duplicates or unique and then either synchronize of the files or execute some other operation (i.e. delete duplicates). The key feature of this tool is that the search for duplicates is not limited strictly to the path in the destination structure. The purpose is to synchronize (or cull) the files, not the folder structure.
